# Advanced-Programming-Project-
Final version of Advanced Programming project in Java
# Description
## Phase 1
In this phase we were supposed to write code for a social network designed by AP teaching assistant team and the interface was only terminal.(The object oriented programming rules needed to be observed)
## Phase 2
Next, some simple extra features added to the social network but the main part was observing clean code rules and designing a graphical interface for project.
## Phase 3
The final phase (the one which is uploaded here) was to run the prosses on network. So we changed the general structure of code and divided it in two parts: Server and Client.
package shared was designed because of some common things between client and server which is imported in both parts.
Also some features was added to this phase like offline support (which was perfomed by an offline data base which events was saved there)
And Bots like calculator, vote and tic-tac-toe game (Purpose of this part wast Reflection in Java)
